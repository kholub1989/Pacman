Pac-Man is a maze arcade game developed and released by [Namco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namco) in 1980. The original Japanese title of Puck Man was changed to Pac-Man for international releases as a preventative measure against defacement of the arcade machines by changing the P to an F. Outside Japan, the game was published by Midway Games as part of its licensing agreement with Namco America. The player controls [Pac-Man](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man_(character)>), who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. Eating large flashing dots called "energizers" causes the ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.
